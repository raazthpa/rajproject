   	 	   	  	  	  <h3>How Does Technology Impact our Daily Life?</h3>
   	 	   	  	  	  <p>Over the last two decades, our lives have been slowly taken over by technology. 
					  Take a moment to look around you. How many screens do you see? Did you include the 
					  one you’re reading this on?Our Wi-Fi-enabled gadgets have changed the way we work, 
					  play, and even raise our children. Today’s offices would be unrecognizable to workers 
					  of the past thanks to the proliferation of emails, video conferencing, tablets, laptop
					  computers, and other relatively recent innovations. Meanwhile, more and more of our 
					  personal time is influenced by our gadgets (OK, smartphones) with each passing day.<br>So
					  have we reached peak-technology? Hardly.The novelty of constant online connections and 
					  instant communication may have begun to wear thin for older generations, but the next wave 
					  of Americans have no such qualms. Their tech-dependent lifestyles are already causing huge 
					  changes in both the professional and private spheres. The change may be inevitable…unless 
					  the Wi-Fi cuts out, of course.<span id="remaining"> 
					 <br><br>For most of the last century, communicating professionally meant writing letters, 
					 sending faxes,
					 or spending hours on the phone. Not anymore. Email is now the primary means of communication in 
					 the modern workplace. We are communicating more, faster, and better than ever before. And employers
					 have been reaping the benefits. A major report cited by British newspaper The Telegraph found that 
					 the incorporation of technology into the workplace has led to an “84% increase in productivity per 
					 hour for office workers since the 1970s.” The major influencers? Email, business software, and yes,
					 even cell phones. We don’t leave technology at the workplace. In fact, our private lives might be
					 even more tech-enabledthan our professional lives. In the 1980s and 1990s, our televisions were often
					 the height of our home technology. Some people had clunky personal computers, a Nintendo for the kids,
					 and maybe even a telephone in their car (remember those?).The only time we don’t use technology is when
					 we are exercising flying sleeping, well, dead.<br><br>
					 Technology is now so integrated with our lives that going without it can cause severe anxiety for some.
					 It’s not hard to see why. Technology has taken over.Both our professional and personal lives are now 
					 technology dependent.While older generations are fighting back with unplugged retreats,the next wave of
					 Americans can’t picture their lives without tech. They might not have anything to worry about. The future
					 favors these digital natives.</span> </p>
